##chapter 1

The hush of sand against your cheek as you emerge from wave-lapped unconsciousness. 
Some warm moist furred thing pressing at your forehead.  

I made it, you think. Though this is probably a dream.  

You open your eyes. The warm moist furred thing has the giant antlers of a reindeer, crooked against the blue sky. It seems to be regarding you with some interest.  

Are you a reindeer, you ask it without speaking.  

It says nothing.
